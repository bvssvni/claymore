Get ready:
  1. figure out the scene format
    - finish glTF import for GFX
    - evaluate glTF? better have something API agnostic
    - fall back to my own format
  2. find and export relevant models

Implement:
  1. High-level graphics pipeline (entities, materials, techniques)
  2. Basic rendering with shader compositing
  3. Grid
  4. Turn-based action (move, attack, wait)
  5. ... profit!
